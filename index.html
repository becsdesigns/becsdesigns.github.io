In the heart of Tyler, Texas, the essence of rustic charm melds with contemporary flair to give rise to Bec's Designs. Founded by Travis and Rebecca Jaquess, this dynamic duo boasts a combined experience of 25 years in the furniture and retail industries. The agency stands as a testament to their passion, expertise, and an insatiable desire to reshape the design landscape.

  Travis, with his keen eye for trends, holds pivotal roles in some of the biggest retail giants, understanding the pulse of the market. Rebecca, on the other hand, possesses a natural flair for design, often infusing the soul of Texas into every piece she creates. Together, they are a force to reckon with.

Their home in Tyler isn't just a residence; it's a melting pot of creativity. Their two teenagers, growing amidst sketches, mood boards, and brainstorming sessions, often throw in their two cents, making the designs even more relatable to the younger generation.
</p><p>

Bec's Designs has quickly become synonymous with the "Texas Vibe" - a blend of the state's vast landscapes, rustic charm, and the modernity of urban living. Visitors often feel they are walking through a design timeline that begins with the rugged cowboys and ends in a sleek, modern Texas city.

But Travis and Rebecca don't just stop there. With their feet firmly rooted in Texan soil, they have their eyes set on the horizon. Their "plan for world domination" isn't just a quirky tagline for their brand; it's their mission. Exhibitions in New York, Paris, and Tokyo are on the horizon, and the distinct Texas touch is finding admirers from all corners of the globe.

The story of Bec's Designs isn't just about furniture or retail. It's about two individuals who, with their dedication, love for their roots, and global aspirations, craft a narrative that resonates with people, irrespective of borders. It's a story of a Texan heart with a global pulse.
